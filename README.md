- The purpose of this repository will be to create an expense tracker application that will allow users to keep track of their expenses.
- Pandas will be used to handle the data analysis.
-  There will need to be a database created to store the incoming expenses that are entered by users
- I am planning on using Mongo DB for my database needs, however it is possible this may change in the future. 

# Future Development:

- Create a reminder future that  notifies a user  that they need to enter their expenses soon
