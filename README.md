- The purpose of this repository will be to create an expense tracker application that will allow users to keep track of their expenses.
- Pandas will be used to handle the data analysis.
- There will need to be a database created to store the incoming expenses that are entered by users.
- I am planning on using PostgreSQL for my database needs.

# Techonologies and Libaries used:
- Backend: Flask(python)
- Data Analysis: Pandas
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/Javascript(Use of React or VUE.JS will for a more robust UI will come in the future.) 

# Future Development:
